## Goal

I create this repository to track my review and practice of algorithms and data structures.

## Plan

1. Data Structures Fundamentals

- [x] Arrays
- [ ] Matrices
- [ ] Linked lists
- [ ] Stacks
- [ ] Queues
- [ ] Trees (BSTs, AVL, etc.)
- [ ] Heaps
- [ ] Hash tables
- [ ] Graphs

2. Classic Algorithms

- [ ] Bubble Sort
- [ ] Quicksort
- [ ] Mergesort
- [ ] Binary search
- [ ] BFS
- [ ] DFS
- [ ] Divide and conquer strategies
- [ ] Dynamic programming (DP): Memoization, tabulation.
- [ ] Dijkstra
- [ ] Floyd-Warshall
- [ ] Kruskal
- [ ] Prim

3. Algorithms Time Complexity

- [ ] Determining Complexity

## Directory Structure

The directories are organized as follows:

```
/1-data-structures-fundamentals
    /arrays
        fundamentals.MD
        problem1.md
        solution1.py
    /linked-lists
    ...
/2-classic-algorithms
...

```

- fundamentals.md: Use this file for notes or summaries about the topic.
- problem1.md: Write problem descriptions here.
- solution1.py: Include your implementation.
